/* WHILE loop

/*
Main difference between for and while is
FOR LOOP is used when the user wants to purposely end the program and run it till he requires the result.
WHILE LOOP is used when the user doesnt know when the condition satisfies.

example:

FOR loop will be used when there will be 10 packets of rice to be emptied, and the user will be knowing 
the limit of the total number of packets.

Whereas,

WHILE loop will be used when there will be n number of packets of rice to be emptied, and he doesnt know 
the limit of the total packets of the rice.
